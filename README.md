# coloringBook
Final project for CS131; a website that has coloring pages you can click to fill.

## About
A Python project submitted for Harvey Mudd's CS181 final. It's mostly an exploratory project that delves into different technologies, as well as flexing unused webdev skills. 

As the name implies, coloringBook offers coloring pages which you can open and color by using a fill bucket. Pillow is used to detect the edges of the lineart and only fill a certain area with color. 

## Technologies
* Flask, a Python framework for web applications
* Pillow for image processing
* HTML canvas
